                Javascript is a cross-platform, object oriented language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment, Javascript can be connected <br>
                to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
                <br>
                <br>
                Javascript contains a standard library of objects , such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, controls structures, <br> and statements. Core Javascript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example;

                <ul>
                    <li>A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web(WWW)</li><br>
                    <li>Good working knowledge fo Hyper Text Markup Language(HTML)</li><br>
                    <li>Some progamming experience. If you are new to programming. Try one of the turorials linked on the main page about Javascript.</li>

                <span>Javascript And Java</span><br><br>
                avaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily known for making web pages interactive. It was initially <br> designed for client-side web development, running directly within a user's web browser, but its capabilities have expanded. <br><br>
                Java is a widely used, high-level, object-oriented programming language and computing platform. Created in 1995 by Sun Microsystems (now owned by <br> Oracle), it is known for its "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) capability, which means compiled Java code can run on any device with a Java Virtual <br>Machine (JVM).

                <span>Hello World</span><br><br>
                To get started with writing Javascript, open the Scratchpad and write your first "Hello World" Javascript code:

            </p>

            <div id="code">
                function greetMe(yourName){ alert("Hello"+ yourName);} <br><br>
                greetMe("World");

            </div>

            <p>
                <span>Variable</span><br><br>
                You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules. <br><br>

                A Javascript identifiers must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign : subsequent characters can also be digits. Because Javascript is case sensitive , <br> letters include the characters A through Z and characters a through z. <br><br>

                You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as a and u in identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers , <br> Some examples of  legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
